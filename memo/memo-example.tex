		\texttt{padajar-memo} is a memo template made by Paolo Adajar, originally made in Spring 2025 using the formatting of \texttt{padajar-pset} (which has been turned into a package, \texttt{padajar-default}). This template will be used for brief memos, like notes for advisors or quick write-ups for implementation partners.

		As it's based off of the article class, it doesn't have much in the way of "useful" features. Just a relatively simple setup.
