``padajar-templates`` is a set of templates created by Paolo Adajar (paoloadajar@mit.edu) in Spring 2025, with clean templates for memos, psets, and slides. They created these templates in 2025, based upon their earlier format [``paolo-pset``](https://github.com/padajar/paolo-pset/tree/main), which has since been deprecated.
